## Who am I?

I am a Geospatial Data Analyst who uses **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** approaches and applications to map biodiversity and field crops at local, regional, and global scales. These help in ensuring sustainable use of such resources and guiding relevant policy interventions. In that endeavor, I rely on big data on platforms such as **`R`**, **`Python`** and **`Google Earth Engine`**. I also embrace Shell scripting, High Performance Computing, and Cloud Computing with such big data. Besides these, I find fun in counter-intuitive debates around **whys** and **what ifs**.

## Work in progress

Impact of land degradation and climate change on livelihoods of **tea** and **coffee** farmers globally. In this, I map tea and coffee fields using high resolution satellite images and visually interpreted cropland polygons within deep learning and machine learning frameworks. The work is not only relevant for the livelihoods of the farmers but also in assessing amount of such crops coming from deforested lands as regulated in the European Commission Regulation on Deforestation-free products [link](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/forests/deforestation/regulation-deforestation-free-products_en).
